# MC Crack The Code

## Description
This is a [Micro Club](https://github.com/MicroClub-USTHB) challenge. The goal is to crack a password by navigating between an 2D array of digits:
|   |  |  |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4| 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

The navigation is set by reading a file that contains many lines of strings, each string contains random 'U', 'D', 'R', 'L' combinations.

- 'U' for Up

The cracked password represents a drawer's lock
